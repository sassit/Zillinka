# Chainlink NodeJS External Adapters

These examples provide a basic framework for developing Chainlink external adapters in NodeJS. 

There are two oracle examples:
- [Unix Time](./unixtime/README.md) fetches the current unix time
- [Rhine Pegel Gauge](./rhine_gauge/README.md) fetches the gauge level (pegel level) of the Rhine river at Kaub station

See above README files for further instructions on how to use the oracle, where the contracts are deployed, etc.
